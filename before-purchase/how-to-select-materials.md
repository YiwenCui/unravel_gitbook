# How to select materials

## B**ase On Purpose**

* outdoor activities

The right textile and material for outdoor activities should have the features including high durability, moisture management, UV-proof, and resistance to stain. Some equipments for specific use like skiing, sailing, rocking climbing should also have high level of cut-resistance and slip-resistance. See below table for the comparison of different materials.

| Materials/ Features | Durability | Water-repellence | UV-proof | Elasticity |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Polyester | High | High | High | Low |
| Nylon | High | High | High | High |
| Cotton | Medium | Low | Low | Medium |
| Linen | Medium | Low | Low | Low |

In general, synthetic material is a better choice compared to natural material for outdoor activities. Some fabrics combined with both synthetic and natural material will performance both functionality and comfort.

* daily commute

If you are a daily commuter like me, make sure that the garment that you purchase matches your company dress code. In general, the material should have features including high-comfort, wrinkle resistance, breathability and easy to clean . See below table for my recommendation for daily commuter.

| Materials/Features | Breathability | Wrinkle-resistance | Elasticity | Care and wash |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Cotton | High | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Wool | High | High | High | High |
| Rayon | High | Low | High | Low |
